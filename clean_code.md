# Principles on writing clean code
What follows are time-less principles on how to write good code. The ideas are taken from "Clean Code - A handbook of agile software craftmanship", the here listed (often directly quoted) highlights are things I wish I would apply more often.

## Leave the campground cleaner than you found it
- We often say that we would go back and clean it later, but _later equals never_.
- Managers want the truth, even when they don't like it. They want good code, while being obsessed with the schedule. Your job is to defend the code as much as the managers defent their requirements and schedule. It's unprofessional to underestimate the risks of making a mess.
- Code with no tests is not clean. No matter how readable and accessible it is!
- Code should run all the tests and have no duplications.
- Check if an object or method is doing more than one thing. An object should be broken into > 2 objects. A method should be refactored, having one method that says what it does and submethods how it's done.
- We are authors: You might think that most effort goes into writing. The ratio if reading to wrting is well over 10:1. We are _constantly_ reading code to be able to write new code.
