--- Creating a virtual environment from scratch ---

virtualenv test_env                         # Creates a folder, containing a virtual environment
cd test_env
source test_env/bin/activate                # Activates that environment 
which python3
which pip3
pip3 list                                   # Lists all packages used in that environment
pip3 install <PACKAGE-NAME>                 # Installs package
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt      # Writes all installed packages to a .txt file
                                            # (with that, env can be easily recreated)
deactivate                                  # Deactivates the environment again


--- Creating a virtual environment with a package list ---
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 test_env     # Optional: Use certain python version
pip3 install -r requirements.txt            # Uses requirements.txt inside env folder to
                                            # install packages
deactivate


--- Misc ---

- If one uses a virtual environment, it is recommended to not put the project files into 
the environment folder. Keep them separate. The environment folder can be deleted 
and easily recreated by using a requirements.txt file.

- pip3 list lists all the globally installed packages
